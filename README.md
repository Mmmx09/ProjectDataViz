## Visualizing E-Waste data 

**Check [our web](https://mmmx09.github.io/ProjectDataViz/) here**

In our project, we explore the growing issue of electronic waste and its environmental impact. With technology evolving rapidly, more devices are being discarded, contributing to pollution and resource depletion. Using a dataset of around 3,000 records on e-waste recycling, we analyze key factors such as device lifespan, disposal methods, and hazardous materials. Through data visualization, our goal is to highlight global e-waste trends and emphasize the importance of responsible recycling for a more sustainable future.

Visualizing E-waste Data is a web based interactive visualization that provides a glimpse into the global e-waste distribution and carbon footprint changes.
