## Visualizing E-Waste data

In our project, we explore the growing issue of electronic waste and its environmental impact. With technology evolving rapidly, more devices are being discarded, contributing to pollution and resource depletion. Using a dataset of around 3,000 records on e-waste recycling, we analyze key factors such as device lifespan, disposal methods, and hazardous materials. Through data visualization, our goal is to highlight global e-waste trends and emphasize the importance of responsible recycling for a more sustainable future.

Visualizing E-waste Data is a web based interactive visualization that provides a glimpse into the global e-waste distribution and carbon footprint changes.

## Data source

`e_waste dataset final.csv` is our main dataset and it involves about 3000 pieces of information about e-waste recycling.

- Data Limitations noteï¼šThe carbon footprint data in this study only considered the emissions in the recycling and transportation stage, and did not include the carbon footprint in the production and use stages of the equipment. As a result, the high energy consumption of appliances during the use phase is not reflected in the data, which can result in the carbon footprint of various devices looking similar.

`Processed_E_Waste_Data.csv` is the dataset we summarize the amount of e-waste and recycling in each region, and then calculate the recycling rate.

`Processed_E_Waste_Trend_Data.csv` the format of the dataset was changed to reflect e-waste changes from 2010 to 2023.

`Latitude-longitude.csv` is the longitude and latitude information of the location and we find these in this web: (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview)
