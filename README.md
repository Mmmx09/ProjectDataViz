# E-Waste and the Environment: Analyzing Recycling Trends and Impact
In our project, we explore the growing issue of electronic waste and its environmental impact. With technology evolving rapidly, more devices are being discarded, contributing to pollution and resource depletion. Using a dataset of around 3,000 records on e-waste recycling, we analyze key factors such as device lifespan, disposal methods, and hazardous materials. Through data visualization, our goal is to highlight global e-waste trends and emphasize the importance of responsible recycling for a more sustainable future.
